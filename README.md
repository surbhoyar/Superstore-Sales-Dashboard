📊 Key Insights & Business Recommendations

**1. Profitability vs. Discounting (The "Profit Trap")**
       - Insight: There is a significant negative correlation between high discounts and profitability. Transactions with discounts over 20% frequently result in a net loss.
       - Evidence: The Central Region often shows high sales volume but lower profit margins compared to the West, primarily due to aggressive discounting strategies.
       - Recommendation: Implement a discount cap of 15% for the Furniture category to protect margins.

**2. Product Category Performance**
       - Insight: Technology is the powerhouse category, contributing the highest profit margins (approx. 45% of total profit) despite not having the highest unit volume.
       - Evidence: Sub-categories like Copiers and Phones are high-value drivers, while Tables and Bookcases are often "loss leaders" due to high shipping costs and returns.
       - Recommendation: Bundle low-profit Furniture items with high-margin Office Supplies to increase the average basket value and offset shipping costs.

**3. Regional Deep-Dive**
       - Insight: The West Region (specifically California and Washington) is the most consistent revenue generator.
       - Evidence: While the East region has high peaks, the West maintains a steadier profit ratio across all segments.
       - Recommendation: Reallocate marketing budget from underperforming cities in the South to expand the "Home Office" segment in the West.

**4. Seasonality & Trends**
       - Insight: Sales exhibit strong seasonality, with a massive spike in Q4 (November–December).
       - Evidence: Historical data shows a 30-40% increase in sales during the holiday season compared to Q1.
       - Recommendation: Optimize inventory levels for "Office Supplies" starting in September to avoid stockouts during the year-end peak.
